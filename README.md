## Logic Problems
```
At McDonalds one can buy chicken nuggets in packages containing 6, 9 or 20 pieces.  Write a 
Python function that accepts an integer, num, as an argument and decides whether or not it is 
possible to buy num nuggets at McDonalds
```
```
Write a function, add_it_up(), that takes a single integer as input and 
returns the sum of the integers from zero to the input parameter.

The function should return 0 if a non-integer is passed in.

def better(n):
    sum = 0
    for num in range(n + 1):
        sum += num
    return sum
```
```
Given two integer numbers return their product only if the product is greater than 1000, else return their sum.
```

```
Given 2 ints, a and b, return True if one if them is 10 or if their sum is 10.

makes10(9, 10) → True
makes10(9, 9) → False
makes10(1, 9) → True
```
